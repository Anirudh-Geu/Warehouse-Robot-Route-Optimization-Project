🤖 Warehouse Robot Route Optimization

A browser-based interactive simulation for optimizing the movement of a warehouse robot. 
Design your warehouse layout, define pickup and delivery points, and simulate robot navigation using A* pathfinding and a nearest neighbor heuristic for multi-stop routing.
